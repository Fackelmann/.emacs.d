# My Emacs init file

I'm uploading my init file to github so I can easily pull it any time I start working on a new system.

It might be also interesting to other Emacs users; at least I've learned from looking at the configuration of other users. I wouldn't recommentd just copying it though, I think your configuration should grow organically with your needs.
