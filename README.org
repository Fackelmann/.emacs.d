* General configuration

Use command key as meta (macOS):
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq ns-command-modifier 'meta)
#+END_SRC

Fido mode for minibuffer autocompletion (instead of Helm or Ivy):
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(fido-mode t)
(icomplete-vertical-mode t)
#+END_SRC

I don't like the ~custom*~ variables being saved in my config file and cluttering it. I prefer to have them in their own location.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq custom-file "~/.emacs.d/custom.el")
  (load custom-file)
#+END_SRC

Likewise, I don't like having backup files (~) all over the place. But they are sometimes useful. This setting saves all of them under the same directory.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq backup-directory-alist '(("." . "~/.emacs.d/backups")))
#+END_SRC

Inhibit the startup screen. I'll take the ~scratch~ buffer, thank you very much.
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq inhibit-startup-screen t)
#+END_SRC

I barely use the mouse, so the tool bar and menu bar are just taking screen real state.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (tool-bar-mode -1)
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
#+END_SRC

And I like having the clock in the mode line, so I can easily tell the time when I'm in full screen.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (display-time-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

Wrap around lines:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-visual-line-mode t)
#+END_SRC
